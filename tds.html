        <h3>What is TDS in water?</h3>
        <p> Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in water are some organic and inorganic materials, which include minerals and ions that are dissolved in a particular quantity in water. When water passes through stones, pipes or different surfaces, the particles are absorbed into the water. TDS in water can come from different sources such as minerals in chemicals used for treating water, runoff from the road salts and chemicals or fertilizers from the farms.

        <h3>Why do we need to measure Total Dissolved Solids?</h3>
        <p>Testing the water is a great way to check the quality of water that you receive and use for different purposes. Here are some reasons you need to measure TDS in water.
            <br><br>
            Taste- High levels of TDS in water affects the taste of your drinking water. Your water may taste bitter, salty or sulfuric depending on the type of dissolved solids present in water.
            <br><br>
            Health Purposes- Water with high TDS is completely safe to drink. However, some substances such as lead, or copper can lead to health hazards.
            <br><br>
            Maintenance of Filters- Water filtration systems are affected by a high level of TDS. Testing the water purifier systems regularly will ensure that the filters work properly
            <br><br>
            Cooking- Though high TDS doesn’t affect health, it can alter the taste of your food.
            <br><br>
            Cleaning- High TDS in water leaves ugly spots on your utensils. This type of water also fades the color of your clothes, lead to a buildup in your sinks, tubs, and faucets.

        <h3>Drinking water TDS</h3>
        <p>
            Here are the two tables which discuss the palatability quotient and acceptable TDS level.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>TDS Level in parts per million(ppm)</th>
                    <th>Palatability Quotient</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Between 50-100</td>
                    <td>Excellent for drinking</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>150-250</td>
                    <td>Good</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>250-300</td>
                    <td>Fair</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>300-500</td>
                    <td>Poor</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ABove 1200</td>
                    <td>Unacceptable</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <h3>Is low TDS water harmful to human body?</h3>
        <p>
            TDS present in water is not a measure of any single contaminant and so is generally not regulated as a health issue by many government agencies. A high TDS level, however, can affect the taste and odour of water. The Environmental Protection Agency in the US has set the maximum recommended level of 500 milligrams per litre (mg/L).
            <br>
            The TDS level in water can be determined with the help of a TDS meter. A TDS test helps in determining the total amount of dissolved solids present in water. However, it doesn’t identify any individual compounds, the sources. As a result, it is essential to conduct some additional tests to determine the contaminants present in water.
