        <h3>What is Water Temperature?</h3>
        <p>
            Water temperature is a physical property expressing how hot or cold water is. As hot and cold are both arbitrary terms, temperature can further be defined as a measurement of the average thermal energy of a substance . Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules, so temperature in turn measures the average kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules . This energy can be transferred between substances as the flow of heat. Heat transfer, whether from the air, sunlight, another water source or thermal pollution can change the temperature of water.

        <h3>Why the Temperature of Water is Important?</h3>
        <p>
            Temperature is an important factor to consider when assessing water quality. In addition to its own effects, temperature influences several other parameters and can alter the physical and chemical properties of water. In this regard, water temperature should be accounted for when determining :
            <br>
            – Metabolic rates and photosynthesis production
            <br>
            – Compound toxicity
            <br>
            – Dissolved oxygen and other dissolved gas concentrations
            <br>
            – Conductivity and salinity
            <br>
            – Oxidation reduction potential (ORP)
            <br>
            – pH
            <br>
            – Water Density 
        </p>

        <h3>What Factors Influence Water Temperature?</h3>
        <p>
            Water temperature can be affected by many ambient conditions. These elements include sunlight/solar radiation, heat transfer from the atmosphere, stream confluence and turbidity. Shallow and surface waters are more easily influenced by these factors than deep water .
            <br>
            - Sunlight
            <br>
            - atmosphere
            <br>
            - Turbidity
            <br>
            - confluence
            <br>
            - Man-made influences

        <h3>What are the Units?</h3>
        <p>
            As temperature measures thermal energy, scales have been developed to give temperature values meaning relative to other values. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales are defined by the degrees at which water freezes and boils . The Celsius scale is also referred to as centigrade because there is a 100 degree interval between the two defined points (freezing and boiling of water) . The Kelvin scale is based on the theoretical point of absolute zero .
